## About rhythmical

In short, rhythmical is a small lib that transforms a nested array of primitives (typically note strings) to a flat array of note events:

```js
Rhythm.render(
  ['C4', ['E4', 'G4'], 'B4', 'D5'],
  4
).map(({ value, time, duration }) => [value, time, duration]);
```

We can visualize the nested array `['C4', ['E4', 'G4'], 'B4', 'D5']` like this:

<RhythmicalTree rhythm={['C4', ['E4', 'G4'], 'B4', 'D5']} height={150} />

This is what we get as output:

```js
[
  ['C4', 0, 1],
  ['E4', 1, 0.5],
  ['G4', 1.5, 0.5],
  ['B4', 2, 1],
  ['D5', 3, 1]
];
```

That flat output can easily be played back with [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) or anything that works like MIDI. Or we can render a piano roll:

<PianoRoll
  noteRange={['C4', 'D5']}
  events={renderRhythmObject([['C4', ['E4', 'G4'], 'B4', 'D5']])}
/>

... or as a score:

<Score
  width={600}
  height={100}
  staves={renderRhythmObject([['C4', ['E4', 'G4'], 'B4', 'D5']])}
/>

In my opinion, this is the closest to human way to represent rhythm as a data structure + it is also really easy to understand. The format is strongly influenced by [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/).

To find out more, you can either read the [README](https://github.com/felixroos/rhythmical#rhythmical) or check out the (still experimental) [REPL](https://felixroos.github.io/rhythmical/).
