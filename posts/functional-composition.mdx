If you have a music education background, the words functional and composition will have a different meaning than if you have a coding background:

| word        | music                                                           | code                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| functional  | functional harmony focuses on the relation of chords to a tonic | functional style is a way of coding that primarily uses functions for everything |
| composition | writing new music                                               | wiring up functions in a particular way                                          |

So i guess, if combining the two, we could compose the harmonic functions of a piece of music by composing functions in code...

## function composition in code

In functional programming, function composition works by using the output of one function as the input of another.

Let's look at following two functions:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
add(1, 2); // 3

const mul = (a, b) => a * b;
mul(2, 3); // 6
```

If we want to "compose" the two functions, we can use the result of one as the input of the other:

```js
add(1, mul(3, 2)); // equals 1 + (3 * 2) = 7
// or
mul(2, add(1, 3)); // equals 2 * (1 + 3) = 8
```

That's basically it, but writing it this way will get confusing very quickly.

### curry

To be able to compose functions in a non confusing, readable way, let's add some curry...
A curried function supports "partial applciation", which means it will give us a function back if we only pass not all parameters.
The returned function will accept the remaining parameters.
We could define them like this:

```js
const add = (a) => (b) => a + b;
add(1)(2); // 3
const mul = (a) => (b) => a * b;
mul(2)(2); // 4

add(1, 2); // does not work
mul(2, 2); // does not work
```

To be able to still use our functions in a traditional way (both params at once), we can use ramda to curry our functions properly:

```js
import R from 'ramda';

const add = R.curry((a, b) => a + b);
add(1)(2); // 3 => apply one param after the other
add(1, 2); // 3 => apply both params at once
const add1 = add(1); // apply one param and save the function under a special name
add1(2); // 3

const mul = R.curry((a, b) => a * b); // equivalent to a => b => a * b
mul(2, 3); // 6 => apply both params at once
mul(2)(3); // => apply one param after the other
const mul2 = mul(2); // apply one param and save the function under a special name
mul2(2); // 4
```

You might now question how this might be useful, as this just looks like a overly complicated way of adding and multiplying numbers.

### compose

Now having properly curried functions, we can finally use compose, which also comes with ramda:

```js
import R from 'ramda';
const add = R.curry((a, b) => a + b);
const mul = R.curry((a, b) => a * b);

const f = R.compose(add(1), mul(2)); // x * 2 + 1
f(3); // 3 * 2 + 1 = 7
const g = R.compose(mul(2), add(1)); // (x + 1) * 2
g(3); // (3 + 1) * 2 = 8
```

compose creates a new functions that applies the given functions from right to left.
As an alternative, we can use pipe to apply functions from left to right, as this IMHO easier to read:

```js
import R from 'ramda';
const add = R.curry((a, b) => a + b);
const mul = R.curry((a, b) => a * b);

const f = R.pipe(add(1), mul(2)); // (x + 1) * 2
f(3); // (3 + 1) * 2 = 8
const g = R.pipe(mul(2), add(1)); // x * 2 + 1
g(3); // 3 * 2 + 1 = 7
```

Now this is much easier to read and will not get worse if we add more operations!

## applying functional composition to music

Having built up the theoretical basis, we can now compose some functions that compose functional music...

### scale patterns

Using an array of indices, we can generate patterns from a scale:

```js
// returns note of given scale
const scale = (name) => Scale.get(name).notes;
scale('C major').join(' '); // 'C D E F G A B'

// returns pattern of indices inside array
const pattern = curry((indices, array) => indices.map((i) => array[i % array.length]));
pattern([0, 2, 4], scale('C major')).join(' '); // 'C E G'
// more musician friendly: like pattern, but starting on index 1
const degrees = curry((indices, array) =>
  pattern(
    indices.map((i) => i - 1),
    array
  )
);
degrees([1, 3, 5], scale('C major')).join(' '); // 'C E G'
// or as a more readable version:
const scaleDegrees = curry((pattern, name) => degrees(pattern, scale(name)));
scaleDegrees([1, 3, 5], 'C major').join(' '); // 'C E G'
```

We can also do some nesting magic:

```js
// just add the parent index to each child (- 1 because not zero indexed!)
const nestedDegrees = (indices) => map((i) => indices.map((d) => i + d - 1));

const nest = (patterns) =>
  pipe(...patterns.slice(1).map((pattern) => pipe(nestedDegrees(pattern), flatten)), degrees)(patterns[0]);

nest([
  [1, 4, 5],
  [1, 3, 5],
])(scale('C major'));
// this is the same as:
degrees([1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5, 7, 9], scale('C major'));
```

Now we can generate complex patterns with less typing!

### Generating Etudes

With nested patterns, it's easy to create scale etudes, for example, Clarke #2:

import Player from '../components/rhythmical/components/Player.tsx';
import { piano } from '../instruments/piano.ts';
import { renderRhythm } from '../components/rhythmical/rhythmical.ts';
import { nest, scale, clark } from '../components/rhythmical/functional.ts';
import { Score } from '../components/score/Score.tsx';

<Player instruments={{ piano }} events={renderRhythm(clark('C4', 'major'))} />

```js
export const clark = (...[tonic, _scale]) => ({
  duration: 12,
  sequential: [
    {
      duration: 7,
      sequential: nest(
        [
          [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
          [1, 2, 3, 1],
        ],
        [...scale(`${tonic} ${_scale}`), ...scale(`${Note.transpose(tonic, '8P')} ${_scale}`)]
      ),
    },
    Note.transpose(tonic, '8P'),
  ],
});
// renderRhythm(clark('C4', 'major'))
```

This can be easily changed to another scale:

<Player instruments={{ piano }} events={renderRhythm(clark('D4', 'harmonic minor'))} />

```js
<Player instruments={{ piano }} events={renderRhythm(clark('D4', 'harmonic minor'))} />
```

This is cool, but not perfect, as the rhythm object is now full of mystic js code...

### pattern plugin

Let's imagine this notation:

```js
{
  duration: 12,
  scale: 'C3 major',
  sequential: [
    {
      duration: 7,
      sequential: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, { sequential: [1], duration: 2}],
      nest: [1, 2, 3, [2, 1]]
    },
    {
      sequential: [1]
    }
  ]
}
```

This notation requires another tricky bit of implementation, which is mapping over nested objects.
The nest plugin would do something like this:

```js
{
  duration: 12,
  scale: 'C3 major',
  sequential: mapLeafs([
    {
      duration: 7,
      sequential: mapLeafs(
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, { sequential: [1], duration: 2 }],
        (leaf) => mapLeafs(
          [1, 2, 3, [2, 1]],
          (child) => child + leaf - 1))
    }
  ], (leaf) => scale('C3 major')[leaf - 1])
}
```

The result would be this:

```js
[
  [1, 2, 3, [2, 1]],
  [2, 3, 4, [3, 2]],
  [3, 4, 5, [4, 3]],
  [4, 5, 6, [5, 4]],
  [5, 6, 7, [6, 5]],
  [6, 7, 8, [7, 6]],
  [7, 8, 9, [8, 7]],
  {
    sequential: [[1, 2, 3, [2, 1]]],
    duration: 2,
  },
];
```

yields:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, { sequential: [1], duration: 2 }];
```

with chords:

```js
{
  duration: 12,
  scale: 'C3 major',
  sequential: [
    {
      duration: 7,
      sequential: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
      nest: [{ parallel: [1, 3, 5, 7] }]
    },
    {
      sequential: [1]
    }
  ]
}
```

This is just a proposal.. I will come back to this when rhythmical is ready (currently rewriting the core logic... ).
