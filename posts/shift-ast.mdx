Let's talk more about abstract syntax trees (ASTs). This time, about those representing JavaScript syntax.

## shift-ast

One of the more recent AST formats for JS is `shift-ast`.
It allows parsing, manipulating and generating JavaScript code.

### Parse

We can parse a string into an AST using `shift-parser`:

```js
import { parseScriptWithLocation } from 'shift-parser';

let { tree } = parseScriptWithLocation(`const x = 'a';`);
```

which yields:

import {
  ShiftTree,
  exampleAST,
  exampleASTshifted,
  before,
  after,
  codeIn,
  codeOut,
  exampleLocation,
} from '../components/shift/ShiftTree.tsx';
import JSONViewer from '../components/common/JSONViewer';

<DiffViewer
  splitView={false}
  showDiffOnly={false}
  hideLineNumbers={false}
  {...{
    oldValue: before,
    newValue: before,
  }}
/>
This is how the AST looks visualized:

<ShiftTree code={`const x = 'a';`} />

### Manipulate

To transform code, we can walk over nodes with `shift-traverser` and construct new nodes using `shift-ast`:

```js
import { replace } from 'shift-traverser';
import { BindingIdentifier } from 'shift-ast';

let bindingIdentifiers = 0;
tree = replace(tree, {
  enter(node, parent) {
    if (node.type === 'BindingIdentifier') {
      return new BindingIdentifier({
        name: `v${bindingIdentifiers++}`,
      });
    }
    return node;
  },
});
```

This will rename all variables in the AST to `v0`, `v1`, etc, creating the following diff:

import DiffViewer from '../components/common/DiffViewer';

<DiffViewer
  splitView={false}
  showDiffOnly={true}
  hideLineNumbers={false}
  {...{
    oldValue: before,
    newValue: after,
  }}
/>

### Generate

To go full circle, we can take the manipulated AST and generate code from it:

```js
import generate from 'shift-codegen';

generate(tree);
```

which creates the following diff:

<DiffViewer
  splitView={false}
  showDiffOnly={true}
  hideLineNumbers={false}
  {...{
    oldValue: codeIn,
    newValue: codeOut,
  }}
/>

### Source Locations

Together with the ast, we will also get source location information for each node:

```js
import { parseScriptWithLocation } from 'shift-parser';

let { tree, locations } = parseScriptWithLocation(`const x = 'a';`);

locations.get(tree.statements.declaration.declarators.binding);
```

With that, we get the exact location of the binding `x` in our input code:

```json
{
  "start": {
    "line": 1,
    "column": 6,
    "offset": 6
  },
  "end": {
    "line": 1,
    "column": 7,
    "offset": 7
  }
}
```

## What now?

With this tool, sky is the limit, as we can basically take any valid JavaScript code and transform it to suit our needs.

Some things that we can do, which can't be done with regular javascript:

- Rename variables
- Operator overloading
- Simplification of user code
- ... you name it

### Workflow

A good workflow to find out how you want to manipulate your code is

1. go to [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net/)
2. entering your input code and copy AST JSON to file `input.json`
3. entering your target output code and copy AST JSON to file `output.json`
4. compare both files with the diff viewer of choice, e.g. `compare active file with...` in VSCode
5. write the code that creates that diff!

## Outlook

In a future post, I want to show how I used `shift-ast` to create some useful transforms for my new pet project [strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/).

Until then, cheers üç∑
