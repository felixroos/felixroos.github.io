I recently moved this blog from Gatsby to Next.js.

## Why I chose Next.js over Gatsby

While settings up my gatsby blog was quite straightforward, changing it was not that easy.
I was using [gatsby-theme-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-theme-blog/), which allows starting a blog using MDX in no time.
Gatsby uses so called [themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/), where the actual code of the theme is versioned but you can change files by "shadowing".
The advantage is that you get upstream changes without needing to update unshadowed files.
This sounds good in theory, but in practice, it became a little blackboxy:

- I found it hard to know which files to shadow, as I needed to manually crawl through the gatsbyjs monorepo. For example, as for the time of writing this article, the "View plugin on GitHub" link on the [gatsby-theme-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-theme-blog/) doc page is dead..
- In practice, I did not manage to update gatsby-theme-blog to the new version in a reasonable amount of time.
- I did not really know what was actually happening under the hood.
- The worst of all: code splitting seemed to not work with mdx, as everything was in one bundle!

On the other hand, I imagined having a "simple" Next.js project with no layer of abstraction would be much easier to work with.

Also, Next.js had introduced static builds, so I gave it a try.

## Packages

I am using the following packages (excluding packages used in posts):

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the foundation
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for style
- [next-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) for darkmode
- [next-seo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-seo) for quick and easy seo stuff
- [feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) for [RSS feed generation](https://github.com/felixroos/felixroos.github.io/blob/4c62f8496ca78caf1ee28f5f07582537be2e0d17/scripts/rss.js)
- [mdx-bundler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-bundler) to bundle posts which are mdx files
- [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) to parse post metadata

## Bundling MDX

Moving to Next.js, I wanted to migrate all the old posts.
As described in [this post](https://dev.to/pyadav/mdx-bundler-with-next-js-2kg3), there are currently 3 ways to add MDX to a Next.js site:

1. Official MDX support by Next.js [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx)
2. Hashicorp's [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
3. Kent C Dodds's [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)

next-mdx-remote is out because it [does not support imports](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/issues/143).
@next/mdx works great but it has a few caveats:

- [It does not support frontmatter](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx#frontmatter).
- [It requires to export the layout inside each post](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx#layouts).
- It does not support plugins that are ESM only, because [next.config.js does not allow that](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/32239). Unfotunately, I need [remark-math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) and [remark-toc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-toc) which are ESM only.

mdx-bundler does not have those shortcomings. It has a completely isolated bundler, which runs [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).
This makes it independent of Next.js, which means I can build my posts for any platform in the future. Compared to @next/mdx it has only 2 shortcomings:

- dev server is slower and has no hot reload
- might have larger bundles

## Unified Plugins

MDX is built on top of [unified.js](https://unifiedjs.com/), which is a collection of tools to transform content, in my case:

- remark to process markdown
- rehype to process html

To enrich the posts, I am using the following plugins:

- [mdx-prism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdx-prism) / [prismjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs) to highlight code blocks
- [remark-gfm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-gfm) extends markdown syntax to support [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- [remark-math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) + [rehype-katex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex) for formulas
- [rehype-slug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-slug) to add ids to headings.
- [rehype-autolink-headings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-autolink-headings) to add anchor links to headings.
- [remark-toc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-toc) to generate a table of contents.
