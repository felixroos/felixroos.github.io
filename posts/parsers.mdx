In the [last post](./abstract-syntax-trees), I looked at abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
In this post, I want to find out how ASTs are generated using a parser.
I am interested in the possibility to use a parser to create a language that outputs [rhythmical objects](./rhythmical-objects).

## What is a parser

Simply put, a parser reads a source language as text and outputs an AST.
The process involves

- a lexical analyzer that splits creates a list of tokens
- a syntactical analyzer that creates an AST from the list of tokens

Practically, a parser can be used as a basis to create any language you want.
Languages for specific purposes are called domain specific languages (DSLs).

## JS based DSLs for music

Let's look at some examples of JS based DSLs for music. There are already some out there. What I found:

- [tidal.pegjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tidal.pegjs), a parser for tidal style syntax
- [nested tuplets / nestup](https://github.com/cutelabnyc/nested-tuplets), a language for nested rhythms
- [in-seconds](https://github.com/danigb/in-seconds), convert musical expressions to seconds
- [sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema), live coding DSL
