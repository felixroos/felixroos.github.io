## color-tunes

The [explorer](https://felixroos.github.io/color-tunes/#/explorer) is a browser through musical material like chords and scales.

![color-tunes](./img/project-screenshots/color-tunes_explorer.png)

Interesting parts:

- circle of fifth connecting selected notes with lines
- subsets: sets of notes that are contained in the current set (lighter color)
- supersets: sets of notes where the current set is contained in (darker color)
- equivalents: sets that contain the same notes (dashed)
- generate sequences with the permutator

The [player](https://felixroos.github.io/color-tunes/#/tunes) looks like this:

- browses through ireal jazz standards
- color codes each chord by possible parent major scales
- plays back chords using jazzband lib, with different styles
- also uses an improviser that is able to play patterns over the chords

## jazzband

The [main demo](https://felixroos.github.io/jazzband/) contains a searchable ireal jazz standards set.

- each tune can be played back in two different styles (swing or bossa)
- the sheet can be edited using leetsheet snippet format
- the ear training will turn all chords to question marks requiring the user to fill in the chords
- chords and bass notes can also be triggered one after the other (arrow buttons), either as chord or arpeggio

Another [demo](https://github.com/felixroos/jazzband/tree/develop/demo-patterns) of jazzband is a little experiment with patterns:

![jazzband](./img/project-screenshots/jazzband_demo-patterns.png)

- A pattern is just a set of numbers, representing degrees in a scale (1 indexed)
- using the ">" sign, patterns can be nested into each other, allowing more complex structures

[demo-tone](https://github.com/felixroos/jazzband/tree/develop/demo-tone) contains a player with a piano roll:

- contains 6 standards with melody
- experimental attempts to harmonize a melody (using voicing range below melody)

## music-brain

[Analyzes](https://github.com/felixroos/music-brain) the ireal jazz standards set for metadata and chord data, similar to [Analyzing iReal Chord Changes](https://felixroos.github.io/blog/ireal-analytics/).

## music-trainer

Trains sheet reading for trumpet, based on [this project](http://onehungrymind.com/notes-angular-midi/).

The notes are generating with this (horrible looking) UI:

![music-trainer](./img/project-screenshots/music-trainer_quiz-form.png)

The trumpet valves are mapped to the keys J K and L, allowing the program to check if the current key combination fits to the current note:

## circle-beats

[demo](https://circle-beats.stackblitz.io). Vizualizes polyrhythms and polymeters in a circle:
