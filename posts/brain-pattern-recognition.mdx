When sensing the world, our brain constantly tries to recognize patterns to simplify the perceptual chaos.
If a stimulus is easier to comprehend than another, we could argue that it is more pleasing to our brain.

In the context of music, we can say that an interval that is less chaotic will be more consonant, for example:

<Plot
  functions={[(x) => Math.sin(3 * x), (x) => Math.sin(2 * x)]}
  range={{ x: [0, 5 * Math.PI], y: [-1, 1] }}
  width={800}
  height={200}
/>

The above plot shows two sine waves with a 3/2 ratio.
As given by the ratio, 2 cycles of the green curve have the same length as 3 cycles of the orange curve.

The ratio can also be represented as a 2 against 3 rhythm:

<Player
  instruments={{ drums }}
  center={0}
  events={renderRhythmObject(
    {
      duration: 2 / 2,
      parallel: [
        { sequential: ['hh', 'hh', 'hh'], color: defaultPlotColors[0] },
        { sequential: ['bd', 'bd'], color: defaultPlotColors[1] },
      ],
    },
    [inheritProperty('instrument'), inheritProperty('color')]
  )}
/>

You will most likely hear the combination of both patterns as another pattern that is 2 beats long.

Let's try the next ratio from the harmonic series, which is 4/3:

<Plot
  functions={[(x) => Math.sin(4 * x), (x) => Math.sin(3 * x)]}
  range={{ x: [0, 5 * Math.PI], y: [-1, 1] }}
  width={800}
  height={200}
/>

Obviously, this is like a 3 against 4 rhythm:

<Player
  instruments={{ drums }}
  center={0}
  events={renderRhythmObject(
    {
      duration: 3 / 2,
      parallel: [
        { sequential: ['hh', 'hh', 'hh', 'hh'], color: defaultPlotColors[0] },
        { sequential: ['bd', 'bd', 'bd'], color: defaultPlotColors[1] },
      ],
    },
    [inheritProperty('instrument'), inheritProperty('color')]
  )}
/>

Now, the patterns repeats after 3 beats, because the hi hat is not "finished" after 2 beats.

As a third example, let's use a ratio that does not consist of neighboring numbers, like 5/3:

<Plot
  functions={[(x) => Math.sin(5 * x), (x) => Math.sin(3 * x)]}
  range={{ x: [0, 5 * Math.PI], y: [-1, 1] }}
  width={800}
  height={200}
/>

<Player
  instruments={{ drums }}
  center={0}
  events={renderRhythmObject(
    {
      duration: 4 / 2,
      parallel: [
        { sequential: ['hh', 'hh', 'hh', 'hh', 'hh'], color: defaultPlotColors[0] },
        { sequential: ['bd', 'bd', 'bd'], color: defaultPlotColors[1] },
      ],
    },
    [inheritProperty('instrument'), inheritProperty('color')]
  )}
/>

Like the last example, this one repeats after 3 beats.

## A Unit for Consonance

As stated earlier:

> "In the context of music, we can say that an interval that is less chaotic will be more consonant"

If we take the above examples, I would rank them like this:

1. 3/2 - least complex
2. 4/3
3. 5/3 - most complex

So, let me shamelessly define the complexity c for a ratio a/b as:

$$
c = a * b
$$

... which only works for fractions in their most reduced form.

## x

In all of those systems, the amount of intervals one can create is still endless.
It would be neat to have a way of comparing the consonance of two ratios, to be able to limit the number of choices.
