This article explains a recursive algorithm that performs a combinatorial search.
The concept will be used in a future post to find all possible piano voicings for a given chord.

{/* We will walk through the concepts with this urn demo: */}

{/* <Analyzer
  render={({ start, stop, analyze }) => (
    <Urn
      balls={3}
      minItems={2}
      maxItems={5}
      samples={3}
      uniqueItems={true}
      hideCombinations={false}
      canEditSamples={true}
      canEditOrder={true}
      canEditUnique={true}
      picker={(items, number = items.length, strictOrder, unique) => {
        start();
        const results = Permutation.search(
          (collected, solutions) =>
            analyze(
              collected,
              collected.length >= number
                ? []
                : unique
                ? items.filter(
                    (ball) =>
                      !collected.includes(ball) &&
                      (strictOrder ||
                        !solutions.find((solution) => Permutation.isEqual([...collected, ball], solution)))
                  )
                : items
            ),
          (collected, solutions) =>
            collected.length === number &&
            (strictOrder || !solutions.find((solution) => Permutation.isEqual(collected, solution)))
        );
        stop();
        return results;
      }}
    />
  )}
/>
 */}

## The algorithm

The following algorithm can be used to generate permutations of any kind:

```ts
class Permutation {
  static search<T>(
    finder: (path: T[], solutions: T[][]) => T[],
    validator: (path: T[], solutions: T[][]) => boolean,
    concatFn = (_path: T[], _candidate: T): T[] => [..._path, _candidate],
    path: T[] = [],
    solutions: T[][] = []
  ): T[][] {
    // get candidates for current path
    const candidates = finder(path, solutions);
    // runs current path through validator to either get a new solution or nothing
    if (validator(path, solutions)) {
      solutions.push(path);
    }
    // if no candidates found, we cannot go deeper => either solution or dead end
    if (!candidates.length) {
      return solutions;
    }
    // go deeper
    return candidates.reduce(
      (_, candidate) => Permutation.search(finder, validator, concatFn, concatFn(path, candidate), solutions),
      []
    );
  }
}
```

The basic three steps are:

1. call the finder to get possible candidates based on the current path and solutions.
2. validate current path, and if valid, add to solutions
3. if no more candidates => done, if more candidates => repeat

## Classic Combinatorics: Urn model

Let's implement the classic combinatoric urn model with it.

### Basic Urn Implementation

```js
function urn(items) {
  return Permutation.search(
    // all balls that are not yet collected, are available => unique
    (collected) => items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball)),
    // all collections that have the length of the items are valid => pull till empty
    (collected) => collected.length === items.length
  );
}
```

Here, we pass two functions:

- The first function returns a set of items we can pull at a given state. In this case, we return all items that have not been collected yet
- The second function returns a validation function for a given collection to be accepted as "solution". In this case, we only accept collections of the items length

The functions in this case lead to:

- Order is important
- Balls can be pulled once
- We pull till it's "empty"

<Urn
  minItems={2}
  maxItems={5}
  balls={3}
  picker={(items) =>
    Permutation.search(
      (collected) => items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball)),
      (collected) => collected.length === items.length
    )
  }
/>

### Extension 1: pull sample

We can extend the implementation by passing a number of balls that should be pulled:

```js
function urn(items, number = items.length) {
  return Permutation.search(
    (collected) => items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball)),
    (collected) => collected.length === number
  );
}
```

This is like pulling Lotto numbers:

- Order is important
- Each ball is unique (only one can be pulled)
- pulling only a subset (e.g. 6 of 49)

<Urn
  minItems={2}
  maxItems={5}
  samples={2}
  balls={3}
  canEditSamples={true}
  picker={(items, number = items.length) =>
    Permutation.search(
      (collected) => (collected.length >= number ? [] : items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball))),
      (collected) => collected.length === number
    )
  }
/>

The above implementation works, but has a performance flaw: The first function does not include the sample so it will always run till the end, despite the fact that it won't find new valid combinations. Fix:

```js
function urn(items, number = items.length) {
  return Permutation.search(
    (collected) => (collected.length >= number ? [] : items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball))),
    (collected) => collected.length === number
  );
}
```

Returning an empty array means, we have no candidates that could be added => recursion stops.

### Extension 2: ignore order

We could also ignore the order of items:

```js
function isEqual(collectionA, collectionB) {
  return collectionA.sort().join('-') === collectionB.sort().join('-');
}

function urn(items, number = items.length, strictOrder = true) {
  return Permutation.search(
    (collected) => (collected.length >= number ? [] : items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball))),
    (collected, solutions) =>
      collected.length === number &&
      (strictOrder || !solutions.find((solution) => Permutation.isEqual(collected, solution)))
  );
}
```

Note: This implementation of isEqual only works with strings.

A real world usage would be pulling a hand in a card game:

- Order is not important
- Each card is unique
- Pulling only a subset of the deck

<Urn
  balls={3}
  minItems={2}
  maxItems={6}
  samples={2}
  canEditSamples={true}
  canEditOrder={true}
  ignoreOrder={true}
  picker={(items, number = items.length, strictOrder) =>
    Permutation.search(
      (collected) => (collected.length >= number ? [] : items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball))),
      (collected, solutions) =>
        collected.length === number &&
        (strictOrder || !solutions.find((solution) => Permutation.isEqual(collected, solution)))
    )
  }
/>

### Extension 3: Balls can be pulled multiple times:

Lets add a flag called _unique_. If we switch it to false, a ball can be picked multiple times.

A good mental model for this is a combination lock:

- Order is important
- Each number can be used multiple times
- The amount of picks is not related to the amount of available numbers

Another mental model for this without ordering is throwing multiple dice:

- Order is not important
- Each number can be used multiple times
- We throw how many dices we want

<Urn
  balls={2}
  minItems={2}
  maxItems={5}
  samples={4}
  uniqueItems={false}
  canEditSamples={true}
  canEditOrder={true}
  canEditUnique={true}
  picker={(items, number = items.length, strictOrder, unique) =>
    Permutation.search(
      (collected) =>
        collected.length >= number ? [] : unique ? items.filter((ball) => !collected.includes(ball)) : items,
      (collected, solutions) =>
        collected.length === number &&
        (strictOrder || !solutions.find((solution) => Permutation.isEqual(collected, solution)))
    )
  }
/>

```js
function urn(
  items,
  number = items.length,
  strictOrder = true,
  unique = true
) {
  return Permutation.search(
    collected =>
      collected.length >= number
        ? []
        : unique
        ? items.filter(ball => !collected.includes(ball)),
        : items
    (collected, solutions) =>
      collected.length === number &&
      (strictOrder ||
        !solutions.find(solution => Permutation.isEqual(collected, solution)))
  );
}
```

## Final Thoughts

Now we should have a clear understanding of how to perform combinatorial search with a functional approach.
In the next post(s), we will use that knowledge to generate voicings, melodies and rhythms!
