I will write about music and coding here. I have many unordered notes about the combination of both. Many things I have already implemented, and many things I only have ideas about. This blog could be a good catalyst to transform personal chaotic notes into sharper ideas in the (pseudo) light of online exposition.

To spark your interest (am I talking to myself?), here are some things I found fascinating in the more recent past:

- music theory visualization
  - [x] [geometry in the circle of fifth](./pitch-class-sets)
  - [x] [piano rolls](./svg-piano-roll)
  - [x] [colorization of notes](./coloring-pitches) / [musical concepts](./coloring-scales)
- music language exploration
  - [x] [text & JSON formats for musical ideas](./rhythmical-arrays)
  - [ ] building a musical grammar with BNF expressions
- music in the browser
  - [x] [Web Audio API](./web-audio-recorder)
  - [x] libs like [tonal](./chords) & [Tone.js](./rhythmical-playback)
  - [x] [transfering established ideas like TidalCycles to the browser](./rhythmical-objects)
- algorithmic composition
  - [x] [finding voicing through combinatorial search](./voicing-permutation)
  - [ ] voicing transitions
  - [ ] semi automated arranging
- parsing musical data
  - [x] [hacking on ireal pro chord changes](./ireal-changes)
  - [x] [insights in musical data](./ireal-analytics)
