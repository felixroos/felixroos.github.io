visions:

- create simple typings for Morph
- create simpler functions for sequential / parallel / onstep, that just work with one layer of children => multiply with parent duration later?
- try to make nodes immutable. don't keep start / end state on nodes. move it to state
- try to make state immutable. Use Object.freeze?
- try to move unifyAST logic to just another morph step (before all others).
- try to make morph functions work on whole tree => move tree traversal to "user land" (like unify)? Is that better?

In the [last post](./tidal-pegjs), we saw that tidal.pegjs parses a rhythm string into an [AST](./abstract-syntax-trees), which is then used to query events.
For the query implementation, the target AST is independent of the original string.
This means, we could also unify a [rhythmical object](./rhythmical-objects) to the same AST structure and be able to generate events from both inputs with a single function.

## Generating unified ASTs

First, let's use this `unifyAST`, which outputs a [unified AST](./abstract-syntax-trees#unified) from any input:

```js
import { Node, Parent } from 'unist';

export const unifyAST = <From, To extends Node | Parent>(
  getNode: (node: From) => To & { children?: From[] },
  data: From
): To => {
  const node = getNode(data);
  if ('children' in node) {
    return {
      ...node,
      children: node.children.map((child) => unifyAST(getNode, child)),
    };
  }
  return node;
};
```

This implementation is a simplified version on the [`unifyAST` method of the last post](./tidal-pegjs#getting-the-ast), using only one function instead of an object of multiple functions.
The function is now fully typed, extending unist types.

### From a pattern

We can then unify a pattern like this:

```js
import Pattern from 'tidal.pegjs/dist/pattern.js';

const rename = {
  string: 'leaf',
  group: 'sequential',
  layers: 'parallel',
};
export const unifyPatternAST = (patternData, shouldRename = false) => {
  return (
    unifyAST < any,
    Node |
      (Parent >
        ((node) => {
          const { type, value, values, left, right, ...data } = node;
          let children;
          if (values) {
            children = values;
          } else if (value?.type) {
            // some types have a single object as value, which is like a single child
            children = [value];
          } else if (left && right) {
            // polymeter
            children = [left, right];
          }
          return {
            type: shouldRename ? rename[type] || type : type,
            ...data,
            ...(children ? { children } : { value }),
          };
        },
        patternData))
  );
};
export const unifyPattern = (pattern: string, rename = true) => unifyPatternAST(Pattern(pattern).__data, rename); // with rename
```

The shouldRename flag makes renames the types to be consistent with rhythmical. I could've done the renaming the other way around but I wanted less confusion while implementing. I might rename the types in the future to something tidally.

Now we can turn a pattern like `[A [B C]]` into:

```json
{
  "type": "sequential",
  "children": [
    { "type": "leaf", "value": "A" },
    {
      "type": "sequential",
      "children": [
        { "type": "leaf", "value": "B" },
        { "type": "leaf", "value": "C" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Looking at the [tidal.pegjs grammar](https://github.com/gibber-cc/tidal.pegjs/blob/master/src/tidal.pegjs), we can make out the following types:

- group: sequential
- layers: parallel
- onestep
- bjorklund
- degrade
- speed
- rest
- polymeter
- string
- number

TODO: add examples with tree viz + sound demo

### From a rhythmical object

Using the same `unifyAST` function, we can unify a rhythmical object like this:

```ts
export const unifyRhythm = (rhythm: RhythmNode<string>) =>
  unifyAST<RhythmNode<string>, Parent>((r) => {
    const children = getRhythmChildren(r);
    const type = getRhythmType(r);
    const { sequential, parallel, ...obj } = toRhythmObject(r);
    return { ...obj, type, ...(children ? { children } : {}) };
  }, rhythm);
```

Now we can turn this:

```json
["A", ["B", "C"]]
```

into:

```json
{
  "type": "sequential",
  "children": [
    { "type": "leaf", "value": "A" },
    {
      "type": "sequential",
      "children": [
        { "type": "leaf", "value": "B" },
        { "type": "leaf", "value": "C" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

..which is exactly the same AST as we generated earlier from the pattern `[A [B C]]`.

## Querying the AST

We can now write a query function that generates events from an AST, and it will work with rhythmical and with tidal.pegjs as well!
