Let's talk about the basic building blocks of music theory.

## Pitch

Quoting from [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)>):

> pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" [...] Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound

Theoretically, there are infinitely many different pitches, so humans decided on a small set of pitches to use for musical purpose.

## Equal Temperament

To define which pitches we use to play music, we use a so called tuning system.
Most western instruments of today are tuned to [equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament), which uses this formula:

$$
f = 440 * 2^{(n / 12)}
$$

Using any integer n, we can calculate the frequency of any pitch in equal temperament.

## Pitch Classes

For the above formular, solutions that are multiples of 2 belong to the same pitch class.
This results in 12 different pitch classes:

| n   | frequency | pitch class |
| --- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 440       | A           |
| 1   | 466.16    | B           |
| 2   | 493.88    | C           |
| 3   | 523.25    | D           |
| 4   | 554.37    | E           |
| 5   | 587.33    | F           |
| 6   | 622.25    | G           |
| 7   | 659.25    |             |
| 8   | 698.46    |             |
| 9   | 739.99    |             |
| 10  | 783.99    |             |
| 11  | 830.61    |             |
| 12  | 880       |             |

## Pitch Classes

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class) again:

> a pitch class (p.c. or pc) is a set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart, e.g., the pitch class C consists of the Cs in all octaves

## What's a note?

<Claviature
  options={{ range: ['C2', 'C5'], labels: { C3: 'C', D3: 'D', E3: 'E', F3: 'F', G3: 'G', A3: 'A', B3: 'B' } }}
/>

## What's an interval?

An interval is the distance between two notes. Those are the seven basic intervals:

| semitones | musical name | degree | in C |
| --------- | ------------ | ------ | ---- |
| 0         | prime/unison | 1      | C    |
| 2         | second       | 2      | D    |
| 4         | third        | 3      | E    |
| 5         | fourth       | 4      | F    |
| 7         | fifth        | 5      | G    |
| 9         | sixth        | 6      | A    |
| 11        | seventh      | 7      | B    |

The structure of the basic intervals is based on the major scale. In C, we can just take the white keys:

<Claviature
  options={{ range: ['C2', 'C5'], labels: { C3: '1', D3: '2', E3: '3', F3: '4', G3: '5', A3: '6', B3: '7' } }}
/>

So we

An interval is distance between two notes, either expressed in semitones or with its musical term.
Those are the basic intervals:

| semitones | musical name                                 | short    | degree      | in C     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 0         | prime/unison                                 | 1P       | 1           | C        |
| 1         | semitone: minor second, augmented prime      | 2m, 1A   | b2/b9, #1   | Db, C#   |
| 2         | whole tone: major second, (diminished third) | 2M, (3d) | 2, (bb3)    | D, (Ebb) |
| 3         | minor third, augmented second                | 3m, 2A   | b3, (#2)/#9 | Eb, D#   |
| 4         | major third, (dimished fourth)               | 3M, (4d) | 3, (b4)     | E, (Fb)  |
| 5         | perfect fourth, (augmented third)            | 4P, (3A) | 4, (#3)     | F, (E#)  |
| 6         | tritone: augmented fourth, dimished fifth    | 4A, 5d   | #4/#11, b5  | F#, Gb   |
| 7         | perfect fifth, (diminished sixth)            | 5P, (6d) | 5, (bb6)    | G, Abb   |
| 8         | minor sixth, augmented fifth                 | 6m, 5A   | b6, #5      | Ab, G#   |
| 9         | major sixth, diminished seventh              | 6M, 7d   | 6/13, bb7   | A, Bbb   |
| 10        | minor seventh, (augmented sixth)             | 7m, (6A) | b7, #6      | Bb, A#   |
| 11        | major seventh                                | 7M       | 7           | B        |

- An interval consists of a number and a quality
- there are seven different numbers: prime (1), second (2), third (3), fourth (4), fifths (5), sixths (6), seventh (7)
- ... and 5 different qualities: perfect (P), major (M), minor (m), augmented (A) and dimished (d)
- the minor quality is always one semitone lower than its major quality
- the augmented quality is one semitone higher than its major quality
- the dimished quality is one semitone lower than its minor quality

In practice, some combinations of number and quality are never used:

- primes are always perfect
- fifths and fourths are either perfect, augmented or dimished
- seconds cannot be dimished
- the others (thirds, sixths and sevenths) are either major, minor, augmented or diminished

Degrees are a common way to talk about steps in a scale or chord. They are simplification of the interval short notation. One or more preceeding flats (b) or sharps (#) are used instead of succeeding qualities:

- using no modifier implies the major quality (M)
- using a flat (b) implies the minor quality (m)
- using two flats (bb) implies the diminished quality (d)
- using a sharp (#) implies the augmented quality (A)

### Why is this naming system so irregular?

I won't answer this question deeply here, but essentially, western music culture (among others) is based the 7 note scale, inside the 12 pitch system, which is based on the harmonic series. I will write about this in a future post.

### Building intervals from any note

If you want to build an interval from any given note, like the diminished fifth of F#, you can:

1. start from the natural note, which is the note without accidentals (= F)
2. build the interval in its major quality, which is perfect or major (F + 5P = C)
3. add the accidental of the starting note (C + # = C#)
4. add the accidental of the interval quality (C# + b = C#b = C)

## What's a chord?

Simply put, a chord is a minimum of three notes played at the same time.
Depending on the intervals that form between the notes, the chord has a specific character.

### 3 note chords aka triads

The most basic chord is the triad, which consists of three notes, forming two intervals between. There are four basic triads:

| musical name     | short  | intervals | steps   | in C    |
| ---------------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| major triad      | M, ""  | 3M 3m     | 1 3 5   | C E G   |
| minor triad      | m, -   | 3m 3M     | 1 b3 5  | C Eb G  |
| diminished triad | o, d   | 3m 3m     | 1 b3 b5 | C Eb Gb |
| augmented triad  | +, aug | 3M 3M     | 1 3 #5  | C E G#  |

Those are the basic triads, which are essentially a permutation of two stacked minor or major thirds.
